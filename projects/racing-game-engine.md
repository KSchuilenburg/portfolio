description: University project where I worked with 5 programmers to create a racing game engine. I was responsible for AI behaviour of the cars on the track. The engine runs on PC and SteamDeck, made in 8 weeks.

    <li>Our team consisted of 2 AI programmers. We decided to split the AI behaviour in two parts. The other AI programmer would focus on making the cars actually drive. Translating the possible inputs for the car to behaviour output. I was responsible for the track registration. How do AI cars know where they are on the track? What direction should they move towards? What is the best driving line? These were all questions I had to address. In the end, I got inspired by an article on GameAIPro. This article explained placing nodes around the track that store relevant information about the track at that point. Recommended speed for the next turn, maximum recommended speed in general, and how far along the track the agent is for instance.</li>
