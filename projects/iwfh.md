<p>
  <ul>
    <li>As a lead developer, I was heavily involved with a lot of aspects of the game. I helped programmers with their features, helped steer the game's design direction, and was responsible for releasing the game on both Itch.io and Steam.</li>
    <li>The biggest challenge throughout this project was managing my time and striking a balance between project work and productivity work. While it was important to come together with all team leads (Visual Artists, Designers, Programmers, Producer) to discuss team direction and morale, there were definitely moments where I was more valuable as a programmer working on features. I was always more than happy to help other programmers with tasks like AI behaviour, but sometimes it took away from my own development time. 
    Proper communication and scheduling my time throughout the day were pivotal in boosting my productivity and not overworking myself.
