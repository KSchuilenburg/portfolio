    <li>Second big university project where we made a game in 8 weeks. The design team made a prototype for the game beforehand, and together, we fleshed out their concept to a full-fledged game. Improving design concepts, technical implementation, and the art. I acted as a technical lead, but, with only 2 programmers, there was not much to lead. Therefore, I mostly acted as a gateway for communication between the leads and the rest of the team. Technical issues that popped up would be directed to me, and I would make a plan of attack to resolve it most of the time. Whenever designers came up with a new feature, they came to me to discuss the technical possibilities of it.
