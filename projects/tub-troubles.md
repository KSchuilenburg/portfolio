  <ul>
    <li>Working in a small team with 2 programmers, 3 designers, of which 2 also acted as artists, I had to put on many hats. Programming tasks, but also design-related tasks, and helping artists to work with the game engine when necessary. I worked on the audio manager, UI, and the buoys in which to put the ducks.</li>
