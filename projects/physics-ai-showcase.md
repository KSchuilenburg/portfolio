    <li>Fundamentals of physics and AI were taught during this block. This was really the moment where my love for programming AI behaviour started. Learning about pathfinding, A* and its underlying graphs was really interesting to me. After this block, I did a deep-dive into steering behaviour inspired by the AI techniques taught during this block.</li>
