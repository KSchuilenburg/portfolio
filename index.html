        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I have been programming for 7 years now, but have only been developing games for the last 3 years. It has
            quickly become my favourite thing to do, however!
            I have been specialising in game physics and AI (not generative AI) for the last year now, and I absolutely
            love it. Creating AI
            behaviour that feels responsive and realistic feels fantastic!

                        where it is located on the track, should it slow down or speed up, should it make a turn,
                        everything managed through track nodes scattered around the track. The engine runs on both PC
                        and SteamDeck. The game engine was made in 8 weeks.

                        moves towards further away neighbours. All coming together to exhibit flocking behaviour.
                        At the end of the 8 week project, I wrote a blog post showcasing my results:
